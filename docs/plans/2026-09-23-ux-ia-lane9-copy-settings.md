# UX IA and copy, wave 3 lane 9: copy-settings — handoff to a Claude Opus 5.5 subagent

**Tasks:** Task 21 of `docs/plans/2026-09-23-ux-ia-copy.md`.
**Branch:** `claude/ux-ia-lane9-copy-settings` (from `claude/ux-ia-copy-plan` at the commit that added this doc; waves 1–2 and Task 16 are merged into it).
**Worktree:** `/Users/ajeyds/Projects/maestro-ux-ia/lane9-copy-settings`. Work only there.
**Planner/reviewer:** Claude (Opus 5.5). It reviews and merges this branch; you never merge.

## Goal Card

**Goal.** A new user understands every screen on first read. The app says one plain word for each thing
on every surface (web app, Companion panel, and the server messages it shows). The Agent inbox is plainly
separate from the app's own features and names who proposed each job. Long lists keep their headers in
view and say when they are cut off. Settings and Profile are organised into tabs with one spacing rhythm.

**Principles**
- **Plain words over precise jargon.** No abbreviations (JD, KB), no internals (render, slug, endpoint,
  schema paths), no example text in blank fields, no "/" meaning "or". A term that must stay (ATS, MCP)
  is explained once, where it first appears.
- **One word per thing, everywhere.** The glossary (Appendix D0) is binding and pinned by a ratchet.
- **Honesty and safety nuance survive every cut.** Consent, "nothing is submitted without your yes",
  honesty warnings and "can't undo" are shortened, never dropped.
- **Everything from the last plan still holds.** Never lose typed text, never say "saved" while pending,
  focus never to `<body>`, WCAG 2.2 AA, one request per click.
- **No new dependencies. MCP and chat contracts are additive only** (docstrings ≤ ~2,000 chars).
- **Conventions change deliberately**, in the same commit as the code.

**Non-goals**
- Referrals / Contacts work (deferred by the owner), grouping or paginating the tracker, search and sort
  in the URL, an `X-Total-Count` header (Appendix B O3).
- Gender options and "restrictive covenant" wording (legal nuance; owner's call later).
- `keepMounted` on the job workspace tabs, a dot on a tab holding unsaved work.

**Autonomy: peer (adapt-and-advise).** Adapt *how* when a step conflicts with repo reality and log every
deviation with one line of reason. Scope, another task's interface or the Goal Card go back to the
planner. Never expand scope.

## Ground truth (read in this order before writing code)

1. `SYSTEM.md` at the repo root.
2. `docs/frontend-conventions.md` — Task 16 rewrote the Microcopy rules: the **glossary**, errors, separators, toasts, "(optional)", the placeholder rule (no example values in blank fields). They are binding. `frontend/AGENTS.md`.
3. The main plan `docs/plans/2026-09-23-ux-ia-copy.md`: Goal Card, *Owner decisions* (esp. 13–14), *Planner decisions* (esp. 19–20), the **Deviation log** (what waves 1–2 already changed, plan defects to avoid), and your tasks.
4. D §6 (Settings and Profile cards; D's lane L5) and D §7 (Assistant, shell, errors, setup; D's lane L6) in `docs/plans/2026-09-23-ux-ia-appendix-d-copy.md`, plus D §0 (glossary), D §1 (rules and shared primitives, landed in Task 16 as `lib/error-text.ts`: use `couldnt()` / `errorDetail()` for every error you rewrite), D §10 (the real bugs in your groups — fix each with its pin) and the lane docs of waves 1–2 (`docs/plans/2026-09-23-ux-ia-lane{1..6}-*.md`, *Deferred to merge* notes that name your files). D's line numbers are at `8cac7cf9`; waves 1–2 and Task 16 moved code, so re-locate by the quoted text and SKIP rows whose string no longer exists (log them).
5. Lane 4 already did D §6.1's model-card rows (its lane doc *Deferred to merge* lists what is done and what is left); lane 6 did the Connected agents card and A §5's settings rows — do only the deltas. Persona keeps its name (owner decision 13). The sidebar's "Agent inbox" and "Assistant" items are done (lane 5); D §7.1's remaining sidebar words (Career history, Add job) are yours.

## Your definition of done

- Every D row in your groups applied (or logged as dropped with a reason).
- Your ratchet pending blocks (`_PENDING_T21`) in `backend/tests/test_frontend_vocabulary.py`, `test_frontend_error_words.py` and `test_frontend_placeholders.py` (there the blocks are named `_PENDING_EXAMPLES_T<n>`) driven to **zero and deleted** (the ratchets fail if a count is higher or lower than actual — lower each block as you go).
- Every pin that read an old string updated to the new one (D lists them per group); no pin weakened.

## Scope

**Files this lane owns:** D's lanes L5 and L6 in Appendix D *File ownership*, re-checked against the current tree. Shared test files: edit only your own pending blocks and your own pin functions.

**The other wave-3 lanes run at the same time** (7 copy-jobs, 8 copy-resumes, 9 copy-settings, 10 companion-server). Don't edit their files. `docs/frontend-conventions.md` is shared: edit only bullets D assigns to your groups, never reflow other text.

**Never touch:** `SYSTEM.md` (1000/1000; queue changes below), `.slop-baseline.json` files, `docs/ux/`, other worktrees and branches, and the main checkout `/Users/ajeyds/Projects/maestro-career-studio` (live `data/` and the live Docker stack on 3000/8001: never `cd` there, never `docker compose`). Never bare `git stash`. Don't push, rebase or merge.

## Environment

- Python `/opt/anaconda3/bin/python3`; pytest and ruff from `<worktree>/backend`. Frontend from `<worktree>/frontend` (`npm ci` has been run): `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run lint` (0 errors, 5 baseline warnings; React Compiler rules at error level), `node --test lib/*.test.ts`, `npm run build`.
- **Browser checks:** scratch dir `/tmp/maestro-ia-lane9`; backend from `<worktree>/backend`: `/opt/anaconda3/bin/python3 -m uvicorn app.main:app --port 8873` with `DATABASE_URL=sqlite:////tmp/maestro-ia-lane9/app.sqlite3`, every `*_DIR` setting from `backend/app/config.py` under the scratch dir, `ALLOWED_WEB_ORIGINS=http://127.0.0.1:3273,http://localhost:3273`, `PATH=/Library/TeX/texbin:$PATH`, no LLM keys; frontend `API_PROXY_BACKEND=http://127.0.0.1:8873 npx next dev -p 3273` (open `http://localhost:3273`; run `npm run predev` first if it exists and delete what it copies afterwards). Seed MADE-UP data through the API (earlier seed scripts to crib: `/tmp/maestro-sweep-a/`, `/tmp/maestro-sweep-b/`, `/tmp/maestro-fix-sweep/scripts/`). Python Playwright (`from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright`, `channel="chrome"`), real keys and pointer, light and dark, 1280/768/375; screenshots under the scratch dir; tear the stack down afterwards.

## Gates (per task, and all of them before you report done)

- The task's pins (seen FAILING first), plus every `backend/tests/test_frontend_*.py`. Mutation-check every pin you add: break the guarded code, see exactly that pin fail, restore from a backup copy (never `git stash`).
- tsc clean; lint 0 errors; node tests pass; `npm run build` (run last).
- Full backend suite `pytest tests/ mcp_server/tests/ -q` at least once before reporting (baseline at `61a4a15f`: see the plan's *Gate results*); `ruff check .`.
- Slop ratchet: frontend duplication measured on a CLEAN `git archive HEAD` export (`python3 ~/.claude/skills/ai-slop-detector/scripts/slop_scan.py scan <export>/frontend --json` → `duplication`) must stay ≤ **437 lines / 36 clones**; `slop_scan.py check frontend` and `check backend` OK from the export root; backend `complexity_hotspots` ≤ **424** (424 at the branch point: NO headroom, so split any new test or function that reaches cc 10 or 50 lines).
- Logic added in two places goes through a shared helper.

## Commits

One per task with the plan's commit message, ending `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>`. Don't amend or squash earlier commits. Commit this doc's filled-in logs at the end.

## Escalation (autonomy: peer)

Adapt *how* when the plan conflicts with the code and log it below. If a change needs another lane's file, scope, or a Goal Card trade-off: log a deviation note (planned / found / proposed / Goal Card line) and carry on with the rest. Never expand scope.

## Deviation log

| Task | Planned | Did instead | Why (Goal Card line) |
|---|---|---|---|

## Gate results

| Task | Gate | Result |
